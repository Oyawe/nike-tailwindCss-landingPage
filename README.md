## Description

This was implemented using `REACT Js` and `Tailwind CSS`.<br>The website is mobile responsive.<br>`TailWind Css` is one of the best UI libraries out there. I enjoy using it and had fun building this project.<br>The file structure of this project is standard and very easy to comprehend.<br>The Big Shoe image is dynamic btw.

### Setup:

-- install node modules

```sh
npm install
```

-- run dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

-The project loads up in your browserðŸŒŸ
